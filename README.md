A Pygments lexer plugin for the SimTalk 2.0 programming language. This plugin adds syntax highlighting for SimTalk to the Pygments tool.

## Install
You can install it with pip (or your favourite Python ackage manager):
`pip install pygments-simtalk`

Pygments should automatically detect the presence of the lexer and make it available to use.

## Usage

See the Pygments docs and use language name `simtalk`.

## Bugs and Issues
Please create an issue if you encounter any problems with the syntax highlighting. Please include a minimal code sample
along with a description of what you expect to see and what you actually see.
